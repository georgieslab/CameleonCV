# Style Definitions

This document provides **operational definitions** for the five CV styles supported by CameleonCV. These definitions guide both dataset creation and model evaluation.

Each style is defined by:
- **Core Intent** — The communication goal
- **Linguistic Markers** — Observable features that indicate the style
- **Anti-Patterns** — What to avoid
- **Boundary Conditions** — When the style becomes problematic
- **Target Audience** — Who this style resonates with

---

## 1. Professional

### Core Intent
Communicate competence and reliability through industry-standard language. Project the image of someone who understands corporate norms and can be trusted in client-facing situations.

### Linguistic Markers

| Marker | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Formal register | No contractions, measured tone |
| Action verbs | "Led," "Developed," "Implemented," "Coordinated" |
| Quantified impact | "Reduced costs by 15%," "Managed team of 8" |
| Third-person orientation | Focus on role/outcomes, not personal narrative |
| Parallel structure | Consistent grammatical patterns across bullets |

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Casual phrases: "stuff," "things," "a lot of"
- ❌ Emotional language: "passionate about," "love working with"
- ❌ Vague claims: "improved efficiency" (without metrics)
- ❌ First-person narrative: "I really enjoyed..."
- ❌ Exclamation marks

### Boundary Conditions

**Crosses into "stiff"** when:
- Passive voice dominates ("Results were achieved...")
- Jargon obscures rather than clarifies
- All personality is stripped away
- Reads like a legal document

### Target Audience

- Corporate hiring managers
- Traditional industries (finance, consulting, law)
- Formal HR screening processes
- Large enterprise environments

### Example Transformation

**Before:**
> I did a lot of data analysis stuff and made some reports.

**After:**
> Conducted data analysis and developed business intelligence reports for senior stakeholders.

## 2. Academic

### Core Intent
Demonstrate intellectual rigor and scholarly credibility. Signal that you operate within academic norms and can contribute to research-oriented environments.

### Linguistic Markers

| Marker | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Methodological precision | "Employed mixed-methods approach," "Utilized regression analysis" |
| Hedged claims | "Contributed to," "Evidence suggests," "Findings indicate" |
| Nominalization | "The implementation of" rather than "implemented" |
| Complex sentence structures | Subordinate clauses, academic transitions |
| Domain-specific terminology | Field-appropriate technical vocabulary |

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Promotional language: "cutting-edge," "revolutionary," "world-class"
- ❌ Unsubstantiated superlatives: "best," "leading," "top"
- ❌ Oversimplification of complex processes
- ❌ Corporate buzzwords: "synergy," "leverage," "disrupt"
- ❌ Exclamation marks or casual emphasis

### Boundary Conditions

**Crosses into "inaccessible"** when:
- Jargon prevents comprehension by educated non-specialists
- Sentence complexity impedes readability
- Hedging undermines all confidence
- Reads like a dissertation abstract

### Target Audience

- Academic hiring committees
- Research institutions
- Grant review panels
- Scholarly publication contexts

### Example Transformation

**Before:**
> I did a lot of data analysis stuff and made some reports.

**After:**
> Conducted systematic quantitative analyses employing statistical methodologies, synthesizing findings into comprehensive research documentation.

## 3. Confident

### Core Intent
Project self-assurance and leadership presence. Signal that you take ownership, deliver results, and operate with executive-level conviction.

### Linguistic Markers

| Marker | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Direct assertions | "Delivered," "Achieved," "Drove" — no hedging |
| Ownership language | "I built," "I led," "Under my direction" |
| Scale emphasis | Team sizes, budget figures, geographic reach |
| Outcome-first structure | Lead with results, then explain how |
| Short, declarative sentences | Punchy rhythm, no meandering |

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Hedging language: "helped to," "assisted with," "contributed to"
- ❌ Passive voice: "The project was completed"
- ❌ Minimizing qualifiers: "just," "only," "a small team"
- ❌ Permission-seeking tone: "I was given the opportunity to..."
- ❌ Burying achievements in long sentences

### Boundary Conditions

**Crosses into "arrogant"** when:
- Claims cannot be substantiated
- Team credit is individually claimed
- Every sentence starts with "I"
- Reads like bragging rather than reporting

### Critical Rule: No Fabrication

Confident style transforms **how** achievements are presented, not **what** is claimed. 

| Original | Allowed | NOT Allowed |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| "Helped with the project" | "Executed project deliverables" | "Led the project" |
| "Part of a team" | "Team member delivering..." | "Team lead" |
| "Around 30%" | "30%" (remove hedging) | "35%" (changing numbers) |

### Target Audience

- Executive roles
- Leadership positions
- Competitive industries
- Direct-to-hiring-manager applications

### Example Transformation

**Before:**
> I did a lot of data analysis stuff and made some reports.

**After:**
> Delivered data analysis and actionable reports that informed key business decisions.

## 4. Concise

### Core Intent
Maximize information density while minimizing word count. Respect the reader's time by making every word earn its place.

### Linguistic Markers

| Marker | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Sentence length | Average ≤12 words |
| No filler phrases | Eliminate "responsible for," "in order to," "as well as" |
| Telegraphic structure | Subject optional in bullets ("Led team" not "I led a team") |
| Single-clause sentences | Avoid compound/complex structures |
| Verb-first bullets | "Built," "Shipped," "Cut costs by 30%" |

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Redundant modifiers: "completely finished," "very unique"
- ❌ Throat-clearing: "It is worth noting that," "In my role, I was tasked with"
- ❌ Nominalization bloat: "Made an improvement to" → "Improved"
- ❌ Conjunction chains: "and," "as well as," "in addition to" in sequence
- ❌ Explaining the obvious

### Boundary Conditions

**Crosses into "cryptic"** when:
- Necessary context is removed
- Meaning requires inference
- Acronyms aren't explained
- Reads like bullet fragments

### Target Audience

- Technical recruiters scanning quickly
- High-volume hiring processes
- Roles where brevity signals competence
- Supplementary to longer documents

### Example Transformation

**Before:**
> I did a lot of data analysis stuff and made some reports.

**After:**
> Analyzed data. Built reports. Informed decisions.

## 5. Playful

### Core Intent
Convey personality and cultural fit for environments that value authenticity over formality. Show you're human without sacrificing professionalism.

### Linguistic Markers

| Marker | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Functional icons | 🚀 📈 🛠 🎯 (2-4 per section, at line starts) |
| First-person voice | "I built" rather than "Built" |
| Conversational register | Contractions okay, direct address allowed |
| Light self-awareness | One subtle humor moment per section max |
| Dynamic word choices | "Shipped" not "delivered," "Tackled" not "addressed" |

### Icon Usage

**Functional icons (use these):**
- 🚀 Launches, shipping, deployment
- 📈 Growth, metrics, improvements
- 🛠 Tech stack, tools, building
- 🎯 Goals, focus, targets
- 🤝 Collaboration, teamwork
- 🔧 Tools, fixing, optimization

**Personality icons (max 1 per section):**
- ☕ Light humor about work
- 🌱 Learning, growth
- ✨ Quality, polish

**Never use:**
- 😀 😎 🔥 (too casual, no meaning)
- Multiple icons per line
- Icons mid-sentence

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Forced humor or puns
- ❌ Self-deprecation that undermines credibility
- ❌ Slang that doesn't translate globally
- ❌ Excessive enthusiasm (!!!)
- ❌ Sarcasm (reads poorly in text)

### Humor Guidelines

**Allowed (confident, not self-deprecating):**
- "Users actually noticed" ✓
- "Some even worked on the first deploy" ✓
- "Reports stakeholders actually wanted to read" ✓

**Not allowed (undermines credibility):**
- "Not bad for someone still learning" ❌
- "I'm still figuring this out" ❌
- "Turns out I'm pretty good" ❌

### ATS Safety

All playful CVs must be **ATS-safe**:
- Every keyword appears in plain text
- Icons are supplementary, not replacing words
- If icons were stripped, content is complete
- Standard job titles preserved exactly

### Boundary Conditions

**Crosses into "unprofessional"** when:
- Jokes require explanation
- Tone is inconsistent
- Substance is sacrificed for style
- Would embarrass you in an interview

### Target Audience

- Startups
- Creative agencies
- Consumer tech companies
- Roles where "culture fit" is explicit

### Example Transformation

**Before:**
> I did a lot of data analysis stuff and made some reports.

**After:**
> 📊 Turned messy spreadsheets into clear insights — reports that stakeholders actually wanted to read.

## Usage Notes

### Combining Styles
Users may want different styles for different CV sections:
- Summary: Confident
- Experience: Professional
- Skills: Concise
- Projects: Playful

This is valid — the model should handle section-level style selection.

### Style Selection Guidance

| If applying to... | Consider... |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Big 4 consulting | Professional |
| University research position | Academic |
| C-suite role | Confident |
| Technical screening | Concise |
| Early-stage startup | Playful |

### When Transformation Is Minimal

Sometimes the original text already matches the target style. In these cases:
- Minor refinements are acceptable
- Zero-change outputs are valid training data (teaches restraint)
- Flag as "low transformation" in metadata
