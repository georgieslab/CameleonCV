I started by wrangling 18 months of order data—500,000 transactions—to optimize the new layout and slotting strategy. Then came the big move: we steered 12,000 pallet positions and 50,000 SKUs over a intense 6‑week period without missing a beat on customer service (think moving day, but on steroids).\n\n🤝 I led a team of 8 warehouse managers, IT staff, and logistics coordinators, planning every detail. We implemented a new warehouse management system and trained 45 employees, and I redesigned receiving processes to cut average pallet handling from 12 to 8 minutes.\n\n📈 The project delivered $850K in annual savings through lower leases, consolidated staff, and smoother operations. We kept service levels sharp with a 95% on‑time shipment rate during the transition, created SOPs for 15 key workflows, and boosted inventory accuracy from 92% to 98%.\n\n📢 I presented the results to execs, showing a 15‑month payback period.
